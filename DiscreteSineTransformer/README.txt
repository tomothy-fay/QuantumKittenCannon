Making this work.

8 Simple steps to making everything work. (Pro-tip: skip to step 8.)

1) Install CLion.
2) Install the fftw3 library. (pressumably you already have gcc installed)
3) Open CLion.
4) File -> Import Project and open this folder
5) Don't overwrite the CMakeLists.txt file
6) It should work.
7) It probably doesn't work.
8) Harass Tom.
